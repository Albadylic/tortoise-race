### User Stories

As a user, I'd like to click Go and see the tortoises race from left to right.

As a user, I'd like to be notified of which tortoise won the race.

### Hints:

Look into using `transform: translateX(0px);` to move the tortoises.

Move the tortoises over a consistent interval, using `setInterval()` to start and `clearInterval()` to stop the tortoises.

Think about how to implement different speeds for the tortoises using `Math.random()`. There are probably two broad approaches: random timings or random movements.

### Stretch goals:

As a user, I'd like to input custom speeds to control which tortoise moves faster or slower.

As a user, I'd like to pause the race and restart it where it left off.

As a user, I'd like to see a realistic or cartoon image of the animals racing.

As a user, I'd like to add more tortoises to the race.
